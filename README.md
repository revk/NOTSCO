# One Touch Switching test platform
This site provides a test environment for One Touch Switching development. It allows messages to be send and received as if to/from another CP, setting up the response to a match request, and even sending deliberately invalid messages to test error checking.

## Why would someone use this?

One Touch Switching is managed by <a href='https://totsco.org.uk'>TOTSCO Ltd</a>. But at this point their simulator seems not to be fit for purpose, and does not follow the OTS specification even for simple things like the URL paths used (see <a href="https://www.me.uk/2024/06/working-with-totsco.html">blog post</a>). This site is designed to provide an easy to use, useful, self service platform, with no need to book a test slot. It means it can be used to test <i>as you go</i> during development if you want. It should be useful to any CP that is developing One Touch Switching (before you go on to TOTSCO testing). It may also be useful to CPs that haev already developed their One Touch Switching that want to check against an external test system.
