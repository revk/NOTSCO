1. This code, and our hosted version of it (see clause 2, below) is provided
   on basis of no warranty, same wording as clause 15, Affero GNU GPL 3.0
   (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), so copying, and use of
   our hosted version, is only permitted on basis that you cannot, and will
   not, hold the author(s), host(s), or sponsor(s), liable for any loss or
   damages in any way.

Permitted uses:

2. This is run as a free service on https://notsco.co.uk/ but we understand
   that some companies will want to keep everything in house. If you plan
   to use either our hosted version, or run a copy yourself, for testing
   your own systems, you are welcome to do so, free of charge*.

3. If you want to run a free service, available to third parties, using
   this, you also can do so free of charge* but there is not a lot of
   point as we provide it at https://notsco.co.uk/.

Not permitted uses:

4. You may not use this to provide a charged for service, or a service with
   advertising or other monetisation. You may not make any copy of this
   for that purpose. The whole idea is to make this freely available for CPs.

5. We would welcome TOTSCO adopting this; if you are TOTSCO, and you wish
   to make use of this, please talk to us [Andrews & Arnold Ltd] and agree terms.
   TOTSCO running this as an official service would be an ideal outcome,
   and we will help with that, including shutting down our public hosted
   service because it will no longer be needed (if TOTSCO wants),
   and setting up a redirect as well. But paying something for the
   development would be nice, and some agreement over ongoing maintenance.

* All we ask is that if you find anything that needs changing, especially
  if in some way we are not meeting the spec, you provide feedback, or
  better, a pull request, so all can benefit from what you have found.
